# functions

1. Data
- There are many simple data types available, including Colors, GUI Components, and TweenInfos.
2. Animation
- You can use AnimationTrack, LoopTween, and Tween more easily.
3. RunCode
- This will be quite useful, as it allows you to make the code a bit shorter and create more variety with the RepeatForSecond function.
4. DataProfile
- Similar to the profile service, but with more features and requires init function to use.
5. State
- Similar to Fusion's Scope, but with more features.
6. Instances
- You can easily manage instance attributes and distances,
and extract specific IDs using the GetInstanceId function.
It's also similar to Fusion's New function. It has a Children key and a separate OnEvent field.
